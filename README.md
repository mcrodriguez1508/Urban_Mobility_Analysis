# Urban Mobility & Economic Productivity Analysis 🚗📉

![Traffic vs GDP](https://vuestra-imagen-o-grafico-aqui.png) ## 📝 Context
This project investigates the relationship between traffic congestion and GDP per capita across major global cities in 2024. The goal was to determine if time lost in traffic acts as a measurable brake on economic growth by integrating TomTom mobility data with OECD macroeconomic indicators.

## 🛠 Methodology
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Cleaning), NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization).
- **Process:** Data integration from multiple sources, normalization of travel time metrics, and correlation analysis.

## 📊 Findings
- **The "Glass Ceiling":** Identified a moderate negative correlation in developing cities, where a 10% increase in travel time is associated with a drag in economic efficiency.
- **Outliers:** Cities like Bogota and Mexico City show high congestion levels that significantly impact logistics costs and quality of life.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- **Infrastructure Prioritization:** Investment should shift towards mass transit systems in high-density areas to unlock economic potential currently lost in traffic.
- **Logistics Optimization:** Companies should use data-driven routing to mitigate the "congestion tax" on their operations.
